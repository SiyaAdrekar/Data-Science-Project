# Data-Science-Project
In this report, we will be looking at collision data from Montgomery County, Maryland. We will be exploring whether certain road conditions (weather, speed limit, surface condition, etc) are more likely to cause a rear end car accident vs any other type of crash. We will be using the values in this dataset which show the conditions of the road in order to predict the type of accident which occurs.

"This dataset provides information on motor vehicle operators (drivers) involved in traffic collisions occurring on county and local roadways. The dataset reports details of all traffic collisions occurring on county and local roadways within Montgomery County. This dataset shows each collision data recorded and the drivers involved."
